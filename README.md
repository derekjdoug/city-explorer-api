# City Explorer API

**Author**: Dougie Douglas
**Version**: 1.0.3 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

- This API allows the user to access location, weather, and related movie data based on their search inputs. This app calls the LocationIQ, WeatherBit, and Movie DB APIs as appropriate. The frontend is hosted on Netlify and the backend is hosted on Heroku.

## Getting Started

- Refactor all of the code on the server.js file into different modules for increased readability and to separate functionality.

## Architecture

- Modules are being used and called into other files as appropriate to execute the API calls that characterize our frontend experience for the user.
